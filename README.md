# passphrase

Takes a wordlist and randomly generates an 8 word phrase from it. It then provides an estimate of the minimum entropy per word.

This is the entropy per word that a secure random shuffling would produce. Even if an assailant gives you a pre-cooked wordlist passphrase filters it for repeated words. And this entropy minimum is still valid **so long as clojure shuffle's randomness is ensured**.

Using the default /usr/share/dict/words list on my Fedora 27 I get >18 bits per word making a full 8 word phrase >144 bits of entropy.

If an assailant tampers your wordlist successfully then entropy per word will fall.

Passphrase makes use of your wordlist to produce easily communicated passwords.

## So should I use this everywhere?

I can't recommend that you do.

I personally do but the caveats are that your computer can generate random numbers (same with any password generator).

The issue is that clojure shuffle uses a Knuth Shuffle, it's very unlikely to have an internal state to properly shuffle 2^18 ! states. Good discussion [here](https://blog.dandyer.co.uk/2008/04/10/a-java-programmers-guide-to-random-numbers-part-3-seeding/).

## Installation

Latest version is always on [GitHub](https://github.com/wolfmankurd/passphrase).

[Releases](https://github.com/wolfmankurd/passphrase/releases)

## Usage

Make sure you have a wordlist at /usr/share/dict/words

```
$ java -jar passphrase-0.1.0-standalone.jar
```

## Building

Uses [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/)

```
$ git clone git@github.com:wolfmankurd/passphrase.git
$ cd passphrase
$ lein uberjar
```

Jar file will be in ./target/uberjar/ You want the "-standalone" file.

## Todo

* Make it take command line arguments, password length, wordlist path, verbosity.
